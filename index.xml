      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months but my Game Boy emulator is all but finished &amp;ndash; or at least ready to be published. Now, for people following me on GitHub it has been availabe the entire time but now I am at a point where most major features are implemented, plus a few extras, and the UI is presentable!
Since I wrote the entire thing in Rust with egui and eframe as my backend, I was able to quite simply compile it to WASM using Trunk.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months but my Game Boy emulator is all but finished &amp;ndash; or at least ready to be published.
Now, for people following me on GitHub it has been availabe the entire time but now I am at a point where
most major features are implemented, plus a few extras, and the UI is presentable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote the entire thing in Rust with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.egui.rs/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;egui&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;eframe&lt;/code&gt; as my backend, I was able to quite simply
compile it to WASM using &lt;a href=&#34;https://trunkrs.dev/&#34;&gt;Trunk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s available here: &lt;a href=&#34;/gameboy&#34;&gt;Click here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web version does have a few caveats and limitations such as audio sometimes being a little out of sync,
no &amp;ldquo;Recent ROMs&amp;rdquo; list and &amp;ldquo;Store Save&amp;rdquo; directly downloading your save data instead of opening a file dialog.
As for the emulation itself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything crazy or special like a JIT or a FIFO PPU. Nevertheless, it does
have sub-instruction timing, passes quite a few timer tests (and even serial tests!) and is overall accurate enough
to play most games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might write more about some architectural choices in the future and how I leveraged Rust&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; statement
but in the meantime I am setting my eye on emulating the Nintendo DS and learning about JITs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hey, my name is Kevin! I quite like systems programming and computer graphics &amp;ndash; my languages of choice are Rust and C++ (sometimes). Currently, I am quite obsessed with emulation development and its exponentially growing complexity.
Having only written a simple CHIP-8 emulator so far, the next step is of course a Game Boy emulator (DMG-01) which is currently in progress! From time to time, I also dabble in computer graphics as that is my main point of study at university &amp;ndash; from raytracers in CUDA to simple mesh processing.</description>
