      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between the last time I edited this website / blog / homepage and now, quite a few things in my life have changed &amp;ndash; my general interests however have stayed the same with a few new additions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still very much into developing emulators (with some downtime here and there) and even worked on a new one for the Game Boy Advance, partially also for my &lt;a href=&#34;/thesis.pdf&#34;&gt;bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis&lt;/a&gt;. This introduced me to a little bit of Just-in-Time compilation via &lt;a href=&#34;https://cranelift.dev&#34;&gt;cranelift&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; which was both a great source of frustration but also fun and learning. The JIT part of my GBA emulator is far from finished, and I should really get back to it as I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone who has used cranelift for emulation yet, but at the very least the general interpreter is done and many games work, even those using &lt;em&gt;Mode 7&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
