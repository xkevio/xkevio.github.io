        <p>It&rsquo;s been a few months but my Game Boy emulator is all but finished &ndash; or at least ready to be published.
Now, for people following me on GitHub it has been availabe the entire time but now I am at a point where
most major features are implemented, plus a few extras, and the UI is presentable!</p>
<p>Since I wrote the entire thing in Rust with <a href="https://www.egui.rs/"><code>egui</code></a> and <code>eframe</code> as my backend, I was able to quite simply
compile it to WASM using <a href="https://trunkrs.dev/">Trunk</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available here: <a href="/gameboy">Click here!</a></p>
<p>The web version does have a few caveats and limitations such as audio sometimes being a little out of sync,
no &ldquo;Recent ROMs&rdquo; list and &ldquo;Store Save&rdquo; directly downloading your save data instead of opening a file dialog.
As for the emulation itself, I didn&rsquo;t do anything crazy or special like a JIT or a FIFO PPU. Nevertheless, it does
have sub-instruction timing, passes quite a few timer tests (and even serial tests!) and is overall accurate enough
to play most games.</p>
<p>I might write more about some architectural choices in the future and how I leveraged Rust&rsquo;s <code>match</code> statement
but in the meantime I am setting my eye on emulating the Nintendo DS and learning about JITs.</p>
